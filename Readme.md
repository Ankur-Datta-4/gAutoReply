### Desc:

1. Replies to isolated emails with I'm on a vacation message
2. Categorizes message as "Snoozed" (New label if label=snoozed is absent)

### Reference Steps:

1. index/login: Gets access token from services/getAccessToken. Further, invokes checkEmails with random periodicity between 45s-120s
2. index/checkEmails: Lists emails. If the email is unread and isolated from threads, sends a reply email. Further, categorizes as label name mentioned.
   -> We also remove label UNREAD to make sure we don't send double replies
